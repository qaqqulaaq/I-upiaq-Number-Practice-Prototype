Iñupiaq Number Practice Prototype

This is the initial build of a program designed to help learners practice the Iñupiaq vocabulary for numbers, as well as 
basic addition and subtraction with Kaktovik numerals. This page will be expanded with information resources in the future,
and new features will be added to this program.

Instructions:

Main Menu:

The "Numbers" button will take you to the addition and subtraction practice. The "Language" button will take you to the 
vocabulary practice. You may return to the main menu by pressing "Escape" in either of the two modes.

Language:

Click on one of the four buttons that you believe has the correct answer. The difficulty level can be changed by clicking the
arrows at the top of the screen. Note that the level cannot be changed while the countdown is occurring. 

Numbers:

Click on the number boxes at the bottom of the screen to fill in the correct numbers for each digit in the addition or 
subtraction problem. Using the left mouse button to click the upper part of the box will increase the number displayed by 5, 
while clicking the lower part will increase the number by 1. Using the right mouse button will decrease the numbers. To 
input an answer, press the Enter key or click the green check box in the lower right corner of the screen. Clicking over the 
numbers with the left mouse button will allow you to draw to help with solving problems, and clicking with the right mouse
button will erase lines that you have drawn.

The game mode can be changed from addition to subtraction by clicking the "addition" sign, and back to addition by clicking 
the "subtraction" sign. The difficulty level can be changed by clicking the left and right arrows at the top of the screen.
