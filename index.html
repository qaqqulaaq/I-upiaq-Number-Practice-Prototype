	<h1>Iñupiaq Numbers Information</h1>
	
	<p>This is a preliminary source of information about the Iñupiaq vocabulary for numbers, as well as my (very, very preliminary) program for practicing this vocabulary. The program includes modes vocabulary and basic math operations using Kaktovik numerals. Additions and refinement to both the information and the program will occur as time permits. The program is available in each of information sections, as well as the link at the bottom.</p>
	
	<h2>Instructions for Program</h2>
	
	<h3>Main Menu:</h3>

<p>The "Numbers" button will take you to the addition and subtraction practice. The "Language" button will take you to the vocabulary practice. You may return to the main menu by pressing "Escape" in either of the two modes.</p>

<h3>Vocabulary:</h3>

<p>Click on one of the four buttons that you believe has the correct answer. The difficulty level can be changed by clicking the arrows at the top of the screen. Note that the level cannot be changed while the countdown is occurring.</p>

<h3>Number Operations:</h3>

<p>Click on the number boxes at the bottom of the screen to fill in the correct numbers for each digit in the addition or subtraction problem. Using the left mouse button to click the upper part of the box will increase the number displayed by 5, while clicking the lower part will increase the number by 1. Using the right mouse button will decrease the numbers. To input an answer, press the Enter key or click the green check box in the lower right corner of the screen. Clicking over the numbers with the left mouse button will allow you to draw to help with solving problems, and clicking with the right mouse button will erase lines that you have drawn.</p>

<p>The game mode can be changed from addition to subtraction by clicking the "addition" sign, and back to addition by clicking the "subtraction" sign. The difficulty level can be changed by clicking the left and right arrows at the top of the screen.</p>

<h3>Number Conversions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Controls are the same as in the Number Operations mode, but the goal is to convert the base 10 number that is specified in the game instruction box.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
